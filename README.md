Recipe for a dish
This recipe is for chicken tikka that I make at home. It is pretty simple and so the actual recipe would be pretty simple. I will demonstrate how to use HTML5 and upload the content to a website. I will use techniques I learned earlier today to bold, paragraph, and italicize different words and paragraphs.
